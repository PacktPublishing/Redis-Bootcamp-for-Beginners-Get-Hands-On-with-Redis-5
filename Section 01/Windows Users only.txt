Windows Users Only

As we talked in the previous video that Redis doesn't support Windows officially. The last unofficial version of Redis for windows was for version 3. I don't recommend to go for it.
From the next video, we will set up a Linux environment for Windows users.
It's your choice to go for VirtualBox or Vmware to install Ubuntu. I have included instructions for both.


Thanks & Regards
